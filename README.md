"The human brain contains the most advanced consensus model, which is highly decentralized through its parallel processing neural units. Instead of competing to determine who solved the task first, these units share their jobs and solve them together, using dynamic routes among nodes with minimal power consumption. Although migrating completely from Proof-of-Work to a new proof model with such characteristics is challenging, drawing inspiration from the back-propagation process in training neural networks can guide us towards an innovative feed-forward approach. In this approach, each entity finalizes its duty and relays the result to the next step in the protocol, which we call Proof-of-Consistency. With these predefined conditions, there will be a virtual ring among master nodes for each block, responsible for continuously validating and broadcasting agreed transactions."
